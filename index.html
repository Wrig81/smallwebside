          <p>
          
          Between 7 and 4 B.C. before our era in a night from December 24 to 25, Jesus was born in Nazareth. 
          His parents were Mary and Joseph, who were on their way to Bethlehem at the time of his birth. 
          There they are said to have entered their names in a tax list. Mary was heavily pregnant and gave 
          birth to their first son named Jesus in a stable. <br> 
          <br>
          Christians believe that Jesus is not only Mary's child, but also the Son of God, whom people called "Christ."
          This means something like "the Savior." The name Jesus Christ aptly describes the two sides of his special personality. <br> 
          <br>
          Not much is known about Jesus' real life. All the information that is spread today about his 
          life and deeds comes mainly from the four Gospels of the Bible. These so-called "good news" were written by 
          Christians long after his death. They are about his religious messages and miracles he performed. <br>
          <br> <img src="../(Task 1) Build a Tribute Page/image/thank you.png" class="img-thanks" alt="">
          At first, Jesus is said to have worked with his father as a building craftsman. When he was baptized
          in the year 28, he found his true calling. From then on, Jesus devoted himself exclusively to his faith in God - he became 
          a pilgrim (this is the name given to religious people who spread their message while traveling). He stayed mainly in 
          the area of modern-day Israel and Jordan. <br> 
          <br id="video"> 
          He spoke out in favor of the poor and dispossessed. Jesus also addressed the poor, 
          the sick and the outcasts. In his time, anyone suffering from leprosy, deaf-muteness or epilepsy, 
          for example, was considered a leper. No one wanted anything to do with these people, 
          but Jesus turned to them and healed them through closeness and touch.

        <p>Jesus reached many people with his messages. He changed their view of things. His fame increased as he preached in public places. 
          "Love your enemies" is just one of his many teachings. At the same time, the Roman rulers were annoyed by Jesus' great popularity 
          and new views. Pontius Pilate, the Roman emperor's administrator, had Jesus arrested and sentenced to death by crucifixion. 
          This happened in the years 30 or 31 AD.</p> <br>
          
        <p>  On the third day after the crucifixion (Easter), Jesus is said to have been resurrected. Another 39 days later (Ascension), God, 
          his Father, took him back to heaven. And although Jesus of Nazareth lived and preached only in what is now Israel and Jordan, his 
          messages spread around the world. They caused a new religion to emerge - Christianity.</p> <br>
          
          <p >Christians believe in an all-powerful God. In their view, Jesus of Nazareth is the Son of God who came to earth in human form. 
             Even today, around two billion Christians in the world therefore celebrate the birth of Jesus Christ at Christmas.</p>
